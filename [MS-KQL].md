<strong> Explain KQl to me like I am a five year old: </strong>

Kusto Query Language is like a secret code that helps people understand and find important information that is hidden in a really big bunch of data.
Imagine you have a lot of toys in your room, but you need to find your favorite one - your teddy bear. But your room is so messy, you can't find it 
just by looking. That's where Kusto Query Language comes in. It's like a magic wand that helps you find your teddy bear by asking your room questions 
like "Where is my teddy bear?" and "What does my teddy bear look like?"

In the same way, Kusto Query Language helps people ask questions of a big bunch of data to find the information they need. It's a tool that helps people 
search through a lot of information to find just what they're looking for, like finding your teddy bear in your messy room!
